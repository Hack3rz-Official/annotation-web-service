In this video we demonstrate US3a and US3b belonging to R3 and R4. The training service will be executed every 5 minutes if there is enough data to train with, i.e. 100 new data samples as research has shown 100 samples are best suited regarding model improvement and computing performance. Every code submission through our main API gateway will be stored on our database as training data unless it is duplicated code which will be assured by skipping code with exactly the same token ids.
