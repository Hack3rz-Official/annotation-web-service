In this sprint, as part of US8, one of our focuses was on improving the documentation and wiki for the project in general and the different services/applications in particular.
In this demo we go over the wiki that we created and improved throughout our project. We show how the wiki is structured and that we have made several pages for the different services.

For the code's documentation/comments we used Google's Style Guides, which are available for many different languages.

We also added Swagger/OpenAPI to document our API and show each endpoint and their respective request and responses.


Caveats:
- The wiki is still not covering all aspects that we aim to document, this will be done in the upcoming weeks.
- The Swagger documentation currently does not include (response) errors and some endpoints are not fully covered yet. This is also planned to be part of our next submission.
