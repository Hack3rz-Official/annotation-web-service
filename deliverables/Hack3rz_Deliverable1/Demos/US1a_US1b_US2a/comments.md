In this video we demonstrate all planned user stories for this spint, namely US1a, US1b and US2a belonging to R0, R1 and R2. We managed to finish all user stories on time despite some unexpected failures and delays regarding importing and connecting the two libraries provided from UZH for the lexing and predict function. Furthermore, during this sprint three out of five group members got COVID which we had to deal with. 

As you can see in the video, the response for the syntax highlighting is currently coming as ```h_code_values```. This is intended at this point of the project as we have a separate user story in the next sprint which is about researching and transforming the response format. Note that the model is also not trained yet, thus ```h_code_values``` could be completely wrong at this point.
